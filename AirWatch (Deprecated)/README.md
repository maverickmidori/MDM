# MacOS Shell Scripts
Repository for MacOS Shell Scripts.

./Applications - For scripts that auto-deploy various applications in MacOS e.g Microsoft Office.
./Utilities - Scripts that assist with day-to-day MacOS tasks.

Anything else you would like to add, feel free to commit and add to the README as required. 

As a general rule of thumb I try to add scripts that have been tested on real hardware and in the Avondale Ecosystem. Most of these scripts have been passed through a linter. 

Best,

Adam.
